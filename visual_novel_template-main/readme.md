# visual novel template

## Get started

First download the code:  Click the green "Code" button above, then "Download
ZIP".

Unzip the folder onto your Desktop.  This will be your project folder.  There
are a bunch of files in the folder -- the important ones are `index.html` and
`js/script.js`.

## Run the visual novel

It's actually just a webpage.  Double click `index.html` and it will open in
your browser.  


## Edit the visual novel

Edit `js/script.js` with a text editor.  I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)
if you don't have a favorite already.

Scroll to the bottom of the file to find `monogatari.script` -- this is where
all the action is.  You can also change the main screen template, also at the 
bottom of the file.

To see how to use images, search for `alice23`.   The actual image files are
placed in `assets/images`.

After you have made edits, be sure to:
- save (in the text editor)
- reload (in the browser)
